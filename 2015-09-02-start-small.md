It is hard to create habits.
There are many factors at play, especially when existing habits are thrown in the mix.
In this essay lets use these 3 examples:

* making a new friend (social habit)
* speaking a new language
* waking up to run early in the morning

To enforce and build these new behaviors, the brain releases neurochemicals.
These make us feel good, and reincforce the behavior.
When we have a comfortable social interaction we release oxytocin.
When we feel important by learing a new skill seratonin is released.
When we excersize we release endorphins.

These chemicals make the behavior feel good, and keep us hungry for more.

Of course, cocktails of these chemicals can be reseased from one activity.
There is one neurochemical that plays part in any learning activity we take part in: Dopamine.
