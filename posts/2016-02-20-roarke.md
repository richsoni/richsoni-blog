One of my favorite books, if not my absolute favorite that I have read thus far is The Fountain Head by Ayn Rand.
Howard Roarke is the character Rand uses to exemplify an ideal human.

This Roarke quote describes him best: "Before you can do things for people, you must be the kind of man that can get things done. But, to get things done, you must love the doing, not the secondary consequences."

From that the character of Roarke is constructed.
Here are some admirable traits he has:

* creates / does not imitate
* excessive understanding of fundamentals down to the smallest detail (riveting)
* will only sell out his skills not his creativity
* keeps his creativity sacred and pure
* always comes off as a contractor when employed by others
* strong passion to run his own company
* will not alter his ideas
* does not care about labels
* puts his creative work above everything else in life
* not afraid to fail / understands the creative process is the reward
* shamelessly knows and admits all of the above

He is a very interesting character, and I think a lot could be taken away from studying him.
This holds especially true for entrepreneurs since he basically is one.
