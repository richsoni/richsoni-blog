A band focused on fanbase growth is a *startup band*.
If receiving 1,000,000 fans overnight would solve a lot of problems, the band is a startup.

Like Paul Graham says: "A barbershop isn't designed to grow fast. Whereas a search engine, for example, is".
Startup Bands often times have 'goals' which are better described as rewards or consequences of fanbase growth.
The two I hear most often are touring and getting signed to a record label.

These are great things to strive for, but they are more of a trophy than a strategy.
Consider playing big venues/touring: if you book a gig and no one comes, you failed.
Fans sharing tkl and attending the event make it a success.

Startup bands must focus on rapid growth.
These questions should have a logical answer to maintain this focus:
  * does what we are doing have any growth potential?
  * if so, are we doing everything we can to make sure we have that growth?

If these questions cannot be answered the activity is just playing house tkl.
