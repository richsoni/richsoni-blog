# Takeaways

In this book Matt Ridley takes the reader on a tour of many sexual selection theories of evolution.  

In the first part of the book, he explains the Red Queen Theory, and how it applies on the microbiological and biological level.  

The second third of the book discusses various courting paradigms that different animals employ.  

In the final third he relates these paradigms to human courtship, and discusses some biological hypothesis postulate differences between human males and females.  

Overall, it was an interesting read, and I would recommend it to anyone interested.  
However, it is not a life changer per say.  Instead, it offers some interesting thoughts on how we became the way we are (as humans and as sexes).  
For myself, the real value in the book is all in the final third, and the first two thirds are to ensure all readers are sharing the same background knowledge of biological systems, and theories.  
Once the theory is explained, Ridley changes into a more anthropological mode where you learn theories on several topics.  

The following are just a few examples, but there are troves of discussions on other similar topics:  

  1.  The development of human language
  1.  Why humans have less hair than apes, and why we live longer than most
  1.  Biological advantages of being a woman over being a man (and visa versa)
  1.  Why almost always propose to women

This is just a sampling of topics off the top of my head, as I said there are many more.  

Overall, I recommend this to anyone in the mood for reading at interesting book that is on the denser side.
